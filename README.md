TempController
==============

Processing code for my 4-channel Arduino-based temperature controller.

The temperature controller is designed for an Arduino Diecimila clone (Bare Bones Board.) using a HD44780-compatible
LCD display.

It is designed to have three buttons (+, -, and channel select) and a set mode SPST switch.
